## âœ¨ 6.0 Release

Iâ€™m pleased to announce the 6.0 Release. This is our biggest release yet, and after a long journey, the library is now close to the initial idealized vision I had for it. Iâ€™m happy to say that both the style and various APIs are now finalized.

Moving forward, our focus will be on maintaining the library and potentially extending certain functionalities. No major changes are expected unless absolutely necessary.

Massive thanks to [sirdoombox](https://github.com/sirdoombox) for his incredible work. Without him, this library would definitely not be the same.
